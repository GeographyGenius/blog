## Adding Regions
With the latest update, there is now regions of various sections of the world. This is to make it easier to study just a small section of the world at a time so you can learn it well.
For example, in Africa it is split into five regions.
- Northern
- Eastern
- Southern
- Western
- Central

This will be applied to Africa, Europe, and Asia (once I make it!)\
Of course, if you want to learn the entire continent at once, you still can! But this should make it easier.
