## Introducing Custom Quizzes
Custom quizzes have been added to the Geography Genius website, which now allows a user to add or remove questions they don't want. This also allows you to add a title and description, and share the quiz with other people by getting a shareable link.  
To customize a quiz, just go to any preexisting quiz and click the "Customize this Quiz" button.  

Example:  
![showing customize quiz button](/blog/images/customize%20quiz.png)

This allows for limitless possibilites with quiz creation, as now if, for example, you don't want to study all of Africa, you can customize it and choose just the questions you want.  

<!---
_Note: This feature is a work in progress, as the title and description do not show up yet on the quiz page, and capitals show up as countries on the customizing quiz page. This will be updated soon._

Try it out below by [picking a quiz](/geography/), and customizing it!
