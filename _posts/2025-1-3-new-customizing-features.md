## New Quiz Customization Features
There is now a new and easier way to customize a quiz. Once you're on the page, simply click countries on the map to toggle them, instead of painstakingly finding the correct name in a long list.

You can still use checkboxes, if that's what you prefer, but this should make it easier and less tedious.

Different ways to toggle countries being included in the quiz:

Additionally, the title and description fields of custom quizzes now support emojis! ðŸ˜€
